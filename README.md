#Intro
No build needed. You can just view template.html in your browser.

#To Use:
Type in an animal, and open your console in your browser. When you click or tab out of the input (on blur), a different animal call will appear in your console. This is just to demonstrate how to make a factory pattern without using IF statements. Instead, there's a way to use object literals.
